Mozilla now requires extensions to be signed. While I think that's great, the signing process is (as of now) more work than writing the simplest extensions, and users should have an option to bypass that. For now there is be [just such an option](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox?as=u&utm_source=inproduct#w_override-add-on-signing-advanced-users), but I don't know how long it will last.
