gitlex
------
gitlex is a browser extension aiming to provide simple tweaks for [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)'s web pages.

Features
--------
- When creating a new Merge Request, automatically tick `Remove source branch when merge request is accepted`

Installation
------------

### Mozilla
Get the `.xpi`. Mozilla now requires extensions to be signed. While I think that's great, the signing process is (as of now) more work than writing the simplest extensions, and users should have an option to bypass that. For now there is [just such an option](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox?as=u&utm_source=inproduct#w_override-add-on-signing-advanced-users), but I don't know how long it will last.

### Chrome
Get the `.crx` and follow [these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11879334).
